# 🧪 ML & AI Experiments with Colab

This repository showcases a hands-on journey through Machine Learning and AI using **Google Colab** and **TensorFlow**. Each project in this repo is part of a structured roadmap that builds foundational to advanced ML skills — including model training, evaluation, data handling, and visualization.


## 🚀 What's Inside?

- ✅ Image Classification with CNN (Cats vs Dogs)
- ✅ MNIST Digit Classifier
- 🔜 CIFAR-10 Deep Dive
- 🔜 Data Augmentation Techniques
- 🔜 Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models
- 🔜 Custom Dataset Training & Evaluation
- 🔜 Model Deployment (Streamlit/FastAPI)


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn



## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder contains:

- `notebook.ipynb`: Colab notebook with code and outputs
- `README.md`: Project-specific summary
- `assets/`: Supporting images/files



## 📌 How to Use

1. Open any `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
2. Follow along with code, explanations, and visuals
3. Modify the code to try your own experiments
4. Use the models for predictions or fine-tune further



## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:
- Learn ML through projects — not theory alone
- Build a solid ML portfolio for job/internship showcasing
- Understand each model, tweak it, and improve it step-by-step



## 📚 License

This repository is free to use for learning and demonstration purposes.
